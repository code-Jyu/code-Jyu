### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Jorge GonzÃ¡lez

I have just finished a Master in Data Analytics and I am so excited to start a career in the Tech World âš¡.

I worked in Canada and UK as Architect for 7 years. Gaining IT experience in the past years managing and handling
project data information, I realized that some coding skills were needed. 
I was self-taught for a while but eventually I decided to join a Master's Degree Program in Analytics.

This are my main IT skills: Python, MySQL, Machine Learning, Web Scrapping & API's, Matplotlib, Seaboarn, Git and Tableau.

I am a resilient, dedicated and methodical person who is always willing to learn. I am so excited about what I am doing right now ðŸ˜„

You can find in my repositories my main project I worked on while I was in Ironhack:

- [Coffee Analysis](https://github.com/code-Jyu/Coffee-Analysis)
- [Real Estate Barcelona](https://github.com/code-Jyu/Real-Estate-Barcelona)
